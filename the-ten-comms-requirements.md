### The ten requirements for secure, modern, interoperable communications
Communications online are part of our daily lives, so they should live up to some form of standards and work for us, not against us. I've proposed these 10 requirements for secure, modern, interoperable communcations as a way to define "for the people" in the communcations space, where it seems to be heavily debated amongst developers.<br><br>

#### Communicatoins standards should be able to:

1. Transfer data over any medium provided sufficent throughput, from two-way FM radio to bluetooth, to regular TCP/IP internet.
2. Handle text based messaging while on a connection that's limited to 20 Kbps or less.
3. Adapt and change to meet new requirements, without breaking existing compatibility to a reasonable extent.
4. Work over various hosting schemes, such as centralized, federated, P2P, and they should be able to intermingle.
5. Work on hardware old and new, everything from an 80's terminal to the latest AI workstations.
6. Continue to function if the company behind the standard stops development or goes bankrupt.
7. Have flexible licensing to allow for others to build on top of or modify the existing technology without needing to ask for permission.
8. Offer modern end-to-end encryption and perfect forward secrecy mechanisms.
9. Give users control over their data and make it easy to move to and from other platforms.
10. Be audited by third parties without requiring any form of communcation with or approval from the organization that maintains the standard.
