Messaging standards of the future need to be able to:

*   Transfer data over any medium, from FM radio to bluetooth, to regular internet.
*   Handle text based messaging while staying under 20 Kbps
*   Adapt and change to meet new requirements, without breaking existing compatibility
*   Work over various hosting schemes, such as centralized, federated, P2P, and they should be able to intermingle.
*   Work on hardware old and new, everything from an 80's terminal to the latest AI workstations.
*   Continue to function if the company behind the standard stops development or goes bankrupt.
*   Have flexible licensing to allow for others to build on top of the existing technology without needing to ask for permission.
*   Offer modern end-to-end encryption and perfect forward secrecy mechanisms.
*   Give users control over their data and make it easy to move to and from other platforms.
*   Support modern features such as sharing images, audio messages, files in any format, and have the ability to support future messaging features as they're invented.
